# OpenTK Playground

Greetings fellow dev. This is my OpenTK playground, a place where i write stuff with C# and share them with you so you can use them or something.
If i get on a good progress, i might make a full fledged engine out of it :)

# What tools i use or might use:
- OpenTK (The Best C# Wrapper for OpenGL, OpenAL and OpenCL)
- StbiSharp (C# Wrapper for the Stbi Image library - might change it for a C# Wrapped FreeImage library in the future)

A first mesh was born. His name is Billy the Triangle.

Billy grew up quickly and became a somewhat Square.
Also a mention that i expanded the Shader Program code with some Memory Leaks check so i am 100% safe if something goes wrong since my somewhat good checks check everything for me :D
Not only that but the Shader also has some methods for messing around with GLSL uniforms, so this will come in handy when making an MVP (Model * View * Projection) calculation. Off a good start! Thats how i like it.
Also heard of a thing called BufferSubData function, might try it out to see what works and not. might come in handy for Vertex Positions, Normals and UVs.
