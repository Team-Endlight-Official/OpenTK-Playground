# OpenTK Playground

Greetings fellow dev. This is my OpenTK playground, a place where i write stuff with C# and share them with you so you can use them or something.
If i get on a good progress, i might make a full fledged engine out of it :)

# What tools i use or might use:
- OpenTK (The Best C# Wrapper for OpenGL, OpenAL and OpenCL)
- StbiSharp (C# Wrapper for the Stbi Image library - might change it for a C# Wrapped FreeImage library in the future)
